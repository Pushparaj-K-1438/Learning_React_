Package.json 
    It is a configuration for npm which keeps a track of what packages have been installed in our system
    It is keeps an approx version od the packages
    ^ in version is denoting the minor upgrade and if any minor upgrade is there it automatically upgrades eg: 3.2.2 to 3.2.3
    ~ in version is denoting the major upgrade and if any major upgrade is there it automatically upgrades eg: 3.2.2 to 4.0.0
    Safer to use ^ in version

    it keeps a record of exact version of the package/dependency which is installed
    where as it keeps the exact version of the package

npm -- if we need to install the package then we use npm
